  # Branch protection rules
  # These settings help ensure code quality by requiring checks to pass before merging
  
  # Note: The following settings should be configured in GitHub repository settings:
  # 1. Go to Settings > Branches
  # 2. Add branch protection rule for 'main'
  # 3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
  # 4. Select "Check Lint and Format" (lint-and-format job)
  # 5. Enable "Require branches to be up to date before merging"

# Alternatively, use Probot Settings App or configure via GitHub API
# Example configuration (requires github/settings or probot/settings app):
